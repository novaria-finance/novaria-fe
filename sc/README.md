# 📜 Novaria Smart Contracts

## 📌 Introduction
Novaria's smart contracts serve as the backbone of the protocol, enabling yield tokenization and seamless on-chain interactions. Built using Foundry, these contracts facilitate efficient, decentralized, and secure yield management.

## 🏗 Project Structure
The smart contract repository consists of the following key components:
- **📂 `contracts/`** - Contains all core smart contracts.
- **📂 `scripts/`** - Deployment and automation scripts.
- **📂 `test/`** - Unit tests for contract verification.
- **📄 `foundry.toml`** - Foundry configuration file.

## 🔄 Application Workflow
1. **User Deposits Collateral**: 
   - The user locks an asset (e.g., WBTC) into the Novaria vault.
   - A corresponding amount of vault tokens is minted to the user’s wallet.
2. **Yield Tokenization Process**: 
   - The funding rate yield is separated from the principal asset.
   - Two tokens are generated: Yield Token (YT) and Principal Token (PT).
3. **Trading & Liquidity Management**:
   - Users can sell YT to lock in future yield earnings.
   - PT can be held or traded on decentralized exchanges.
4. **Redemption & Settlement**:
   - When the position is closed, PT can be redeemed for the original collateral.
   - Yield is distributed accordingly to YT holders.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation
### 📌 Prerequisites
- Install [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) by running:
  ```sh
  curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
  foundryup
  ```
- Node.js (latest LTS version)
- An Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask)

### 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/novaria-defi/novaria.git
   cd novaria
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   forge install
   ```

## 🚀 Compilation and Testing
### 🔧 Compile the Smart Contracts
Run the following command to compile the contracts:
```sh
forge build
```

### ✅ Run Tests
Execute tests to ensure contract correctness:
```sh
forge test
```

## 🚀 Deployment
To deploy contracts on a testnet or mainnet, execute:
```sh
forge script scripts/deploy.s.sol --rpc-url <NETWORK_RPC_URL> --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```
Replace `<NETWORK_RPC_URL>` and `<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>` with the appropriate values.

## 🛠 Special Instructions
- Ensure your wallet has sufficient test ETH for deployment on a testnet.
- Update environment variables as needed for different networks.
- Regularly run tests after making modifications to the contracts.

## 🎯 Conclusion
The Novaria smart contracts empower yield tokenization with security and efficiency. Developers and contributors are encouraged to explore, test, and contribute to the codebase.
